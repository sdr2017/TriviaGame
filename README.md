# TriviaGame

This is a simple trivia game about animals. The user is presented with 5 random multiple choice questions and given 30 seconds to answer. If time runs out or the user finishes, they are taken to a results page, which shows their correct, incorrect, and unanswered totals with a corresponding graphic. After a few seconds, they are taken back for another round of questions. 

The app is built with Bootstrap and runs with JavaScript.
